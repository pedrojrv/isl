    "Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, `X1 = GPA`, `X2 = IQ`, `X3 = Level` (1 for College and 0 for High School), `X4 = Interaction between GPA and IQ`, and `X5 = Interaction between GPA and Level`. The response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars). Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get `βˆ0 = 50`, `βˆ1 = 20`, `βˆ2 = 0.07`, `βˆ3 = 35`, `βˆ4 = 0.01`, `βˆ5 = −10`.\n",
